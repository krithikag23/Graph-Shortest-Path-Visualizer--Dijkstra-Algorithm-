# Dijkstra & A* Shortest Path Finder

This project computes and visualizes the shortest path in a weighted graph using:

- **Dijkstra Algorithm** (min-heap)
- **A\*** Algorithm (heuristic search)

It also provides visual graph output highlighting the shortest path.

---

## Features
- Calculates shortest path between any two nodes
- Supports both Dijkstra and A* algorithms
- JSON-based graph input
- Path reconstruction for both algorithms
- Visual graph rendering using:
  - Node labels
  - Edge weights
  - Highlighted path (green for Dijkstra, red for A*)
- Comparison visualization: Dijkstra vs A*
